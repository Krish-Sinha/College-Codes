Declare left and right var which will mark the extreme indices of the array
Left will be assigned to 0 and right will be assigned to n -1 
Find mid = (left + right) / 2 Call mergeSort on(left, mid) and (mid + 1, rear)
Above will continue till left < right 
Then we will call merge on the 2 subproblems
